Overall Project Structure:

Kubernetes:

Acts as the main platform for container orchestration. All the core components of the application are deployed here.
The application consists of several microservices, each packaged in Docker containers. Kubernetes manages the deployments, services, and ingresses to ensure scalability and availability.
Kubernetes services connect containers to each other and to external users via Nginx.

Docker:

All components of the application are packaged into Docker images. This ensures portability and ease of deployment across different environments.
Docker Compose is used for local development and testing of all microservices before deploying them to Kubernetes.

Jenkins:

Handles the CI/CD pipeline. On each push to GitHub, Jenkins triggers the build of Docker images, runs tests, and deploys the updated images to Kubernetes.
Jenkins can also trigger Ansible to manage server configurations.

Linux (Ubuntu):

This is the operating system where all project components are deployed. It hosts Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, and is used to run Ansible playbooks.

Ansible:

Used to automate server setup and application deployment.
Ansible playbooks configure Postgres, Nginx, and Kafka, ensuring that all components are properly configured before being launched.

Helm:

Helm templates Kubernetes manifests, enabling dynamic configuration changes across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
Helm charts are created for each microservice, simplifying their deployment and version management.

PostgreSQL:

This is the main database used by the application for data storage. It is connected to the microservices through Kubernetes and Ansible, which handle its setup and management.

Nginx:

Serves as a proxy server to handle incoming HTTP requests and distribute them among the microservices.
Configured by Ansible to support load balancing and HTTPS.

Kafka:

Responsible for message exchange between microservices. For example, one service can publish events while others subscribe to and process them.
Kafka is deployed in a Docker container and managed through Kubernetes.

Redis:

Used for caching data to reduce the load on the database and improve application performance.
Redis is deployed in Docker and integrated with the application via Kubernetes.

Grafana and Prometheus:

Prometheus collects metrics from all services and infrastructure components (Kubernetes, Docker, microservices).
Grafana visualizes these metrics, creating user-friendly dashboards to monitor the system's health and detect issues.
