This project demonstrated the complete deployment of a microservices-based web application using a wide range of DevOps tools, including Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Helm, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Kafka, Redis, Grafana, and Prometheus. We covered the key aspects of the deployment:

-Kubernetes: Orchestration of containers and management of microservices using manifests for deployments, services, and ingresses.
-Docker: Packaging microservices into containers, ensuring application portability and easy deployment.
-Jenkins: Automating the CI/CD pipeline, including building Docker images, running tests, and deploying applications to Kubernetes.
-Ansible: Automating infrastructure setup, dependency installation, and server configuration.
-Helm: Simplifying Kubernetes management through the use of templates and dynamic variables across different environments.
-PostgreSQL: Serving as the primary database for storing application data with high performance and availability.
-Nginx: Acting as a reverse proxy to handle external HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate microservices.
-Kafka: Efficiently handling data streams and messaging between microservices.
-Redis: Caching frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the database and improve application performance.
-Grafana and Prometheus: Monitoring and visualizing the systemâ€™s health, tracking key metrics, and managing alerts.

Key Highlights:
-Using LoadBalancer for external access to Nginx, enabling efficient handling of incoming traffic and balancing it across microservices.
-Deploying and configuring Helm charts to manage Kubernetes applications, simplifying dependency management and updates.
-Setting up Kafka and Redis to handle real-time data streams and caching.
